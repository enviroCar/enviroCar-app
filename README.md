<a href='https://www.envirocar.org/?lng=en'>enviroCar</a> allows you to use your car’s sensor data to investigate the impact that your driving style has on environmental factors such as fuel consumption, CO2 levels, and noise emissions. You can compare your driving statistics and you can optimize your driving efficiency while also reducing your car’s running costs! 
Share your data with the enviroCar Citizen Science Community and collaborate with other citizens, scientists and urban planners investigating such questions as what the effective spatial characteristics of fuel consumption are in your city, how traffic planning can be optimized to reduce emissions effectively and what we can learn from average speed maps.

## Description

### XFCD Mobile Data Collection and Analysis

**Collecting and analyzing vehicle sensor data**

enviroCar Mobile is an Android application for smartphones that can be used to collect Extended Floating Car Data (XFCD). The app communicates with an OBD2 Bluetooth adapter while the user drives. This enables read access to data from the vehicle’s engine control. The data is recorded along with the smartphone’s GPS position data.The driver can view statistics about his drives and publish his data as open data. The latter happens by uploading tracks to the enviroCar server, where the data is available under the ODbL license for further analysis and use. The data can also be viewed and analyzed via the enviroCar website. enviroCar Mobile is one of the enviroCar Citizen Science Platform’s components (www.envirocar.org).


**Key Technologies**

-	Android
-	Java

**Benefits**

-	Easy collection of Extended Floating Car Data
- Optional automation of data collection and upload
- Estimation of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions
- Publishing anonymized track data as Open Data
- Map based visualization of track data and track statistics

## Quick Start 

### Installation

Use the Google Play Store to install the app on your device.
<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.envirocar.app'><img align='right' height='66' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossasia/phimpme-android/development/docs/images/google_play_badge.png'></a>

We are planning to include the project into F-Droid in the near future.

## Development

This software uses the gradle build system and is optimized to work within Android Studio 1.3+.
The setup of the source code should be straightforward. Just follow the Android Studio guidelines
for existing projects.
